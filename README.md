rsyncnet_py
===========

rsyncnet_py is a collection of Python scripts designed for setting up backups on [rsync.net](http://rsync.net), without fiddling around with a GUI or a ton of scripts.

This script works for both Mac OS X and (possibly) any Unix or Unix-like operating system, such as GNU/Linux, BSD, etc.

It's very rudimentary 
for the moment, but I'll be perfecting and cleaning it up. 
Thanks for using!
